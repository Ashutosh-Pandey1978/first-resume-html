# ğŸ’¼ First Resume (HTML Only)

This is my first resume website created using **only HTML**.  
I'm a student aiming to become a Full Stack Web Developer, and this project marks the beginning of my journey.

## ğŸš€ What I Learned

- HTML structure: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, etc.
- Tags like headings, paragraphs, images, lists, links, and the footer.
- How to organize content properly for a basic webpage.

## ğŸ“Œ Future Plans

I'll update this resume as I learn **CSS and JavaScript**, to improve the layout, design, and interactivity.
